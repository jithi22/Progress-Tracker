points theory under consideration Mathematics essential natural sciences engineering medicine finance computer science social sciences Although mathematics extensively used modeling phenomena fundamental truths mathematics independent from scientific experimentation Some areas mathematics such statistics game theory developed close correlation with their applications often grouped under applied mathematics Other areas developed independently from application therefore called pure mathematics often later find practical applications Historically concept proof associated mathematical rigour first appeared Greek mathematics most notably Euclids Elements Since beginning mathematics primarily divided into geometry arithmetic manipulation natural numbers fractions until centuries when algebraa infinitesimal calculus were introduced fields Since then interaction between mathematical innovations scientific discoveries correlated increase development both century foundational crisis mathematics systematization axiomatic method which heralded dramatic increase number mathematical areas their fields application contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than sixty firstlevel areas mathematics Etymology word mathematics comes from Ancient Greek mthma meaning that which learnt what gets know hence also study science word came have narrower more technical meaning mathematical study even Classical timesb adjective mathmatiks meaning related learning studious which likewise further came mean mathematical particular mathmatik tkhn Latin mathematica meant mathematical Similarly main schools thought Pythagoreanism known mathmatikoi which time meant learners rather than mathematicians modern sense Pythagoreans were likely first constrain word just study arithmetic geometry time Aristotle this meaning fully established Latin English until around term mathematics more commonly meant astrology sometimes astronomy rather than mathematics meaning gradually changed present from about This change resulted several mistranslations example Saint Augustines warning that Christians should beware mathematici meaning astrologers sometimes mistranslated condemnation mathematicians apparent plural form English goes back Latin neuter plural mathematica Cicero based Greek plural mathmatik means roughly things mathematical although plausible that English borrowed only adjective mathematical formed noun mathematics anew after pattern physics metaphysics inherited from Greek English noun mathematics takes singular verb often shortened maths North America math Areas mathematics Before Renaissance mathematics divided into main areas arithmetic regarding manipulation numbers geometry regarding study shapes Some types pseudoscience such numerology astrology were then clearly distinguished from mathematics During Renaissance more areas appeared Mathematical notation algebra which roughly speaking consists study manipulation formulas Calculus

into four main areasarithmetic geometry algebra calculusendured until century Areas such celestial mechanics solid mechanics were then studied mathematicians considered belonging physics subject combinatorics been studied much recorded history become separate branch mathematics until seventeenth century century foundational crisis mathematics resulting systematization axiomatic method explosion areas mathematics Mathematics Subject Classification contains less than sixtythree firstlevel areas Some these areas correspond older division true regarding number theory modern name higher arithmetic geometry Several other firstlevel areas have geometry their names otherwise commonly considered part geometry Algebra calculus appear firstlevel areas respectively split into several

Littlewoods Conjecture Number theory began with manipulation numbers that natural numbers displaystyle mathbb later expanded integers displaystyle mathbb rational numbers displaystyle mathbb Number theory once called arithmetic nowadays this term mostly used numerical calculations Number theory dates back ancient Babylon probably China prominent early number theorists were Euclid ancient Greece Diophantus Alexandria modern study number theory abstract form largely attributed Pierre Fermat Leonhard Euler field came full fruition with contributions AdrienMarie Legendre Carl Friedrich Gauss Many easily stated number problems have solutions that require sophisticated methods often from across mathematics prominent example Fermats Last Theorem This conjecture stated Pierre Fermat proved only Andrew Wiles used tools including scheme theory from algebraic geometry category theory homological algebra Another example Goldbachs conjecture which asserts that every even integer greater than prime numbers Stated Christian Goldbach remains unproven despite considerable effort Number theory includes several subareas including analytic number theory algebraic number theory geometry numbers method oriented diophantine equations transcendence theory problem oriented Geometry Main article Geometry surface sphere Euclidean geometry only applies local approximation larger scales angles triangle equal Geometry oldest branches mathematics started with empirical recipes concerning shapes such lines angles circles which were developed mainly needs surveying architecture since blossomed into many other subfields fundamental innovation ancient Greeks introduction concept proofs which require that every assertion must proved example sufficient verify measurement that lengths equal their equality must proven reasoning from previously accepted results theorems basic statements basic statements subject proof because they selfevident postulates part definition subject study axioms This principle foundational mathematics first elaborated geometry systematized Euclid around book Elements resulting Euclidean geometry study shapes their arrangements constructed from lines planes circles Euclidean plane plane geometry Euclidean spacec Euclidean geometry developed without change methods scope until century when Descartes introduced what called Cartesian coordinates This constituted major change paradigm Instead defining real numbers lengths line segments number line allowed representation points using their coordinates which numbers Algebra later calculus thus used solve geometrical problems Geometry split into subfields synthetic geometry which uses purely geometrical methods analytic geometry which uses coordinates systemically Analytic geometry allows study curves unrelated circles lines Such curves defined graph functions study which differential geometry They also defined implicit equations often polynomial equations which spawned algebraic geometry Analytic geometry also makes possible consider Euclidean spaces higher than three dimensions century mathematicians discovered nonEuclidean geometries which follow parallel postulate questioning that postulates truth this discovery been viewed joining Russells paradox revealing foundational crisis mathematics This aspect crisis solved systematizing axiomatic method adopting that truth chosen axioms mathematical problem turn axiomatic method allows study various geometries obtained either changing axioms considering properties that change under specific transformations space Todays subareas geometry include Projective geometry introduced century Girard Desargues extends Euclidean geometry adding points infinity which parallel lines intersect This simplifies many aspects classical geometry unifying treatments intersecting parallel lines Affine geometry study properties relative parallelism independent from concept length Differential geometry study curves surfaces their generalizations which defined using differentiable functions Manifold theory study shapes that necessarily embedded larger space Riemannian geometry study distance properties curved spaces Algebraic geometry study curves surfaces their generalizations which defined using polynomials Topology study properties that kept under continuous deformations Algebraic topology topology algebraic methods mainly homological algebra Discrete geometry study finite configurations geometry Convex geometry study convex sets which takes importance from applications optimization Complex geometry geometry obtained replacing real numbers with complex numbers Algebra Main article Algebra quadratic formula which concisely expresses solutions quadratic equations Rubiks Cube group concrete application group theory Algebra manipulating equations formulas Diophantus century alKhwarizmi century were main precursors algebra Diophantus solved some equations involving unknown natural numbers deducing relations until obtained solution AlKhwarizmi introduced systematic methods transforming equations such moving term from side equation into other side term algebra derived from Arabic word aljabr meaning reunion broken parts that used naming these methods title main treatise Algebra became area right only with Franois Vite introduced variables representing unknown unspecified numbers Variables allow mathematicians describe operations that have done numbers represented using mathematical formulas Until century algebra consisted mainly study linear equations presently linear algebra polynomial equations single unknown which were called algebraic equations term still although ambiguous During century mathematicians began variables represent things other than numbers such matrices modular integers geometric transformations which generalizations arithmetic operations often valid concept algebraic structure addresses this consisting whose elements unspecified operations acting

century Before this period sets were considered mathematical objects logic although used mathematical proofs belonged philosophy specifically studied mathematicians Before Cantors study infinite sets mathematicians were reluctant consider actually infinite collections considered infinity result endless enumeration Cantors work offended many mathematicians only considering actually infinite sets showing that this implies different sizes infinity Cantors diagonal argument This controversy over Cantors theory same period various areas mathematics concluded former intuitive definitions basic mathematical objects were insufficient ensuring mathematical rigour Examples such intuitive definitions collection objects natural number what used counting point shape with zero length every direction curve trace left moving point This became foundational crisis mathematics eventually solved mainstream mathematics systematizing axiomatic method inside formalized theory Roughly speaking each mathematical object defined similar objects properties that these objects must have example Peano arithmetic natural numbers defined zero number each number unique successor each number zero unique predecessor some rules reasoning This mathematical abstraction from reality embodied modern philosophy formalism founded David Hilbert around nature objects defined this philosophical problem that mathematicians leave philosophers even many mathematicians have opinions this nature their called intuitionto guide their study proofs approach allows considering logics that sets allowed deducing rules theorems proofs mathematical objects prove theorems about them example Gdels incompleteness theorems assert roughly speaking that every consistent formal system that contains natural numbers there theorems that true that provable stronger system provable inside system This approach foundations mathematics challenged during first half century mathematicians Brouwer promoted intuitionistic logic which explicitly lacks excluded middle These problems debates wide expansion mathematical logic with subareas such model theory modeling some logical theories inside other

shared many animals probably that numbers realization that example collection apples collection oranges have something common namely that there them evidenced tallies found bone addition recognizing count physical objects prehistoric peoples have also known count abstract quantities like timedays seasons years Babylonian mathematical tablet Plimpton dated Evidence more complex mathematics does appear until around when Babylonians Egyptians began using arithmetic algebra geometry taxation other financial calculations building construction astronomy oldest mathematical texts from Mesopotamia Egypt from Many early texts mention Pythagorean triples inference Pythagorean theorem seems most ancient widespread mathematical concept after basic arithmetic geometry Babylonian mathematics that elementary arithmetic addition subtraction multiplication division first appear archaeological record Babylonians also possessed placevalue system used sexagesimal numeral system which still today measuring angles time century Greek mathematics began emerge distinct discipline some Ancient Greeks such Pythagoreans appeared have considered subject right Around Euclid organized mathematical knowledge postulates first principles which evolved into axiomatic method that used mathematics today consisting definition axiom theorem proof book Elements widely considered most successful influential textbook time greatest mathematician antiquity often held Archimedes Syracuse developed formulas calculating surface area volume solids revolution used method exhaustion calculate area under parabola with summation infinite series manner dissimilar from modern calculus Other notable achievements Greek mathematics conic sections Apollonius Perga century trigonometry Hipparchus Nicaea

Persian such AlKhwarismi Omar Khayyam Sharaf alDn Greek Arabic mathematical texts were turn translated Latin during Middle Ages made available Europe During early modern period mathematics began develop accelerating pace Western Europe with innovations that revolutionized mathematics such introduction variables symbolic notation Franois Vite introduction logarithms John Napier which greatly simplified numerical calculations especially astronomy marine navigation introduction coordinates Descartes reducing geometry algebra development calculus Isaac Newton Gottfried Leibniz Leonhard Euler most notable mathematician century unified these innovations into single corpus with standardized terminology completed them with discovery proof numerous theorems Carl Friedrich Gauss Perhaps foremost mathematician century German mathematician Carl Gauss made numerous contributions fields such algebra analysis differential geometry matrix theory number theory statistics early century Kurt Gdel transformed mathematics publishing incompleteness theorems which show part that consistent axiomatic systemif powerful enough describe arithmeticwill contain true propositions that cannot proved Mathematics since been greatly extended there been fruitful interaction between mathematics science benefit both Mathematical discoveries continue made this very According Mikhail Sevryuk January issue Bulletin American Mathematical Society number papers books included Mathematical Reviews database since first year operation more than million more than thousand items added database each year overwhelming majority works this ocean contain mathematical theorems their proofs Symbolic notation terminology Main articles Mathematical notation Language mathematics Glossary mathematics explanation sigma summation notation Mathematical notation widely used science engineering representing complex concepts properties concise unambiguous accurate This notation consists symbols used representing operations unspecified numbers relations other mathematical objects then assembling them into expressions formulas More precisely numbers other mathematical objects represented symbols called variables which generally Latin Greek letters often include subscripts Operation relations generally represented specific symbols glyphs such plus multiplication textstyle integral equal less than these symbols generally grouped according specific rules form expressions formulas Normally expressions formulas appear alone included sentences current language where expressions play role noun phrases formulas play role clauses Mathematics developed rich terminology covering broad range fields that study properties various abstract idealized objects they interact based rigorous definitions that provide standard foundation communication axiom postulate mathematical statement that taken true without need proof mathematical statement proven disproven termed conjecture Through series rigorous arguments employing deductive reasoning statement that proven true becomes theorem specialized theorem that mainly used prove another theorem called lemma proven instance that forms part more general finding termed corollary Numerous technical terms used mathematics neologisms such polynomial homeomorphism Other technical terms words common language that used accurate meaning that differ slightly from their common meaning example mathematics means other both while common language either ambiguous means other both mathematics latter called exclusive Finally many mathematical terms common words that used with completely different meaning This lead sentences that correct true mathematical assertions appear nonsense people have required background example every free module flat field always ring Relationship with sciences Mathematics used most sciences modeling phenomena which then allows predictions made from experimental laws independence mathematical truth from experimentation implies that accuracy such predictions depends only adequacy model Inaccurate predictions rather than being caused invalid mathematical concepts imply need change mathematical model used example perihelion precession Mercury could only explained after emergence Einsteins general relativity which replaced Newtons gravitation better mathematical model There still philosophical debate whether mathematics science However practice mathematicians typically grouped with scientists mathematics shares much common with physical sciences Like them falsifiable which means mathematics that result theory wrong this proved providing counterexample Similarly science theories results theorems often obtained from experimentation mathematics experimentation consist computation selected examples study figures other representations mathematical objects often mind representations without physical support example when asked came about theorems Gauss once replied durch planmssiges Tattonieren through systematic experimentation However some authors emphasize that mathematics differs from modern notion science relying empirical evidence Pure applied mathematics Main articles Applied mathematics Pure mathematics Isaac Newton left Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed infinitesimal calculus Until century development mathematics West mainly motivated needs technology science there clear distinction between pure applied mathematics example natural numbers arithmetic were introduced need counting geometry motivated surveying architecture astronomy Later Isaac Newton

philosophical debates since least time Pythagoras ancient philosopher Plato argued that abstractions that reflect material reality have themselves reality that exists outside space time result philosophical view that mathematical objects somehow exist their abstraction often referred Platonism Independently their possible philosophical opinions modern mathematicians generally considered Platonists since they think talk their objects study real objects Armand Borel summarized this view mathematics reality follows provided quotations Hardy Charles Hermite Henri Poincar Albert Einstein
